# Projects overview

This is my machine learning projects's overview!

## **`Titanic Classification:`**  

Utilizing Python and data science methodologies, this project aims to construct a predictive model to estimate the probability of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model will analyze historical data to infer survival outcomes based on various passenger attributes. 

### **Project Overview:**

  - **Data Preparation and Exploration:** Initially, the dataset will undergo thorough cleaning and exploration to identify patterns and insights crucial for modeling.

  - **Feature Engineering:** Crafting relevant features from the available data to enhance the predictive power of the model.

  - **Model Development:** Employing the machine learning algorithm `logistic regression` to build an accurate survival prediction model.

  - **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the trained model through appropriate evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

  - **Web Application Development:** Building a user-friendly web application using Flask framework to provide an interface for users to input passenger information and obtain survival predictions in real-time.

## **`SMS Classifier:`** 
Develop a text classification model to classify SMS as either spam or non-spam using data science techniques in Python.
